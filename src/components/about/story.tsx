          Our journey began in 2010 when our founder, Jane Doe, recognized a gap
          in the market for user-centric web development. With a passion for
          clean code and intuitive design, she set out to create a company that
          would prioritize both form and function.

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Over the years, we&apos;ve grown from a small startup to a team of
          dedicated professionals, each bringing unique skills and perspectives
          to our projects. We&apos;ve had the privilege of working with clients
          across various industries, from cutting-edge startups to established
          enterprises.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Today, we continue to push the boundaries of what&apos;s possible on
          the web, always staying ahead of the curve with emerging technologies
          and design trends. Our commitment to excellence and innovation remains
          at the core of everything we do.
